## [3.7.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed — 3-issue bundle from #42 verification (closes [#53](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/53), [#54](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/54), [#55](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/55))

Pure dep bump (`ooxml-swift` 0.13.4 → [0.13.5](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.5)) consuming three follow-ups that were opened during #42 verification:

#### #55 — Path traversal security baseline (P2 pre-existing)

`isSafeRelativeOOXMLPath()` validator + DocxReader sanitization + Header/Footer setter validation. Defense-in-depth against malicious .docx with `Target="../../../etc/passwd"` style rels (read sink + write sink).

#### #53 — Multi-instance Header/Footer auto-suffix (P3 latent)

`addHeader()` × N with default type now produces `header1.xml`, `header2.xml`, `header3.xml` instead of all colliding to `header1.xml`. Mirror for footers + `*WithPageNumber` variants.

#### #54 — `updateAllFields` coverage extensions (P3 test gaps)

Bundles 4 sub-findings: (a) regex schema-drift stderr warning, (b) cross-container counter-sharing doc-comment, (c) header-SEQ no-op test, (d) footnote/endnote round-trip tests.

### Synergy

- #55's sanitization fallback path benefits from #53's auto-suffix logic (multiple rejected paths can't collapse to `header1.xml`)
- #54's stderr warning extends #42 + #41's observability infrastructure
- All 3 bundled in single ooxml-swift release; che-word-mcp consumes via single PATCH bump

### Tests

- 100/100 che-word-mcp tests pass unchanged + 11 new tests from in-progress adjacent work
- ooxml-swift v0.13.5 ships **444/444 tests** (was 408 → +36)

### Compatibility

- **No che-word-mcp source changes** — fix is entirely in ooxml-swift dep
- **No MCP API changes** — all 173+ tools work identically
- Universal binary (x86_64 + arm64) preserved
- Behavior changes (from ooxml-swift):
  - DocxReader silently drops headers/footers with unsafe rel.target (with stderr warning)
  - `addHeader()` × N produces sequential fileNames
  - `update_all_fields` warns on regex schema drift

### Refs

- PsychQuant/che-word-mcp#53, #54, #55 (all opened during #42 verify on 2026-04-24)

## [3.7.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed — `update_all_fields` no longer strips headers/footers (closes [#42](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/42))

Pre-v3.7.1 `update_all_fields` triggered silent data loss on every academic template workflow with VML watermarks (NTPU / 台大 / 政大 thesis templates). Calling `update_all_fields` once + saving stripped 6 headers × ~3600 bytes of template structure (watermarks, page numbers, chapter title STYLEREF) down to 318-byte `<w:p/>` stubs. Variant table from #42 conclusively pinned the locus to `update_all_fields` — no other tool exhibited the strip.

### Resolution

v3.7.1 consumes [`ooxml-swift v0.13.4`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.4) which fixes the root cause: `WordDocument.updateAllFields` now propagates dirty bits honestly. Each container (body / headers / footers / footnotes / endnotes) tracks whether ANY SEQ field was actually rewritten; only confirmed-dirty containers get inserted into `modifiedParts`. Containers without SEQ stay out of `modifiedParts` → overlay-mode `DocxWriter` skips re-emission → original bytes preserved byte-for-byte.

### Tests

- 100/100 che-word-mcp tests pass unchanged (no consumer-side regression)
- Underlying ooxml-swift v0.13.4 ships **407/407 tests** including 4 new `WordDocumentUpdateAllFieldsHeaderPreservationTests`

### Compatibility

- **No source code changes** to che-word-mcp itself — fix is entirely in ooxml-swift dep.
- **No API change**: `update_all_fields` MCP tool signature unchanged; behavior strictly stronger (preserves what it should preserve).
- Universal binary (x86_64 + arm64) preserved.
- **Known limitation**: header that legitimately contains a SEQ field (rare — chapter caption in running header) still re-emits via `Header.toXML()` and strips co-located VML. Out of scope for this PATCH; tracked for follow-up.

### Refs

- PsychQuant/che-word-mcp#42 — incident report from 2026-04-23 NTPU thesis rescue workflow

## [3.7.0] - 2026-04-24

### Changed — autosave Design B + default flip; insert crash hardening

Two coordinated v3.6.0 production blocker fixes from the `che-word-mcp-insert-crash-autosave-fix` SDD:

#### #40 — autosave_every redesigned to Design B; default flipped 0 → 1

Pre-v3.7.0 implementation was Design A: counter incremented AFTER mutation succeeded; checkpoint fired when `count % N == 0`. Failure mode: for `autosave_every: N + crash on mutation K where K%N≠0`, mutations between checkpoints were lost. Worst case (#40 incident): `autosave_every: 3 + crash on mutation 3 = 0 mutations preserved` because counter never incremented (mutation crashed before `storeDocument` ran).

v3.7.0 switches to **Design B**: snapshot dispatch fires at the START of every mutating handler (specifically, at the entry of `storeDocument` BEFORE `openDocuments[docId]` is overwritten). The dispatcher reads `openDocuments[docId]` (the OLD pre-mutation state) and writes it to `<sourcePath>.autosave.docx`. On crash mid-mutation K, the autosave file holds the post-mutation-(K-1) state.

**Default flip**: `autosave_every` default value flipped from `0` (disabled) to `1` (snapshot before every mutation). Maximum safety; perf-conscious callers must explicitly pass `autosave_every: 0` to opt out.

```swift
// Server.swift:storeDocument refactor
internal func storeDocument(...) async throws {
    // Phase C (Design B): snapshot BEFORE we overwrite openDocuments[docId].
    if markDirty {
        dispatchAutosaveCheckpointIfDue(docId: docId)
    }
    // ... existing mutation commit ...
    if markDirty, autosaveEvery[docId] != nil {
        autosaveCounter[docId] = (autosaveCounter[docId] ?? 0) + 1
    }
}
```

**BREAKING (effective)** for v3.6.0 callers:
- Code that omitted `autosave_every` now gets `1` (every mutation snapshots prior state). To restore v3.6.0 disabled-by-default behavior, add `autosave_every: 0` to `open_document` calls.
- Code that passed `autosave_every: 0` explicitly is unaffected.
- Code that passed `autosave_every: N > 0` now sees Design B semantics — snapshot fires at mutation N+1 start (capturing post-mutation-N state), not at mutation N completion.

#### #41 — Phase A structured logging for sequential insert crash investigation

Adds `CHE_WORD_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=debug` env-var-gated diagnostic logger. Off by default (zero overhead in production). When enabled, emits one-line stderr events for `insertImageFromPath` entry/exit, `storeDocument` entry/exit, `dispatchAutosaveCheckpoint` exit. New `WordMCPServer(forceDebugLogging:)` test seam constructor for XCTest introspection.

The 3rd-sequential-insert crash root cause requires runtime instrumentation against an NTPU-style fixture; this release ships the infrastructure so any future session with the fixture can capture the trace via `swift test --filter InsertCrashRegressionTests`. Per SDD non-goals, Phases B/C/D ship regardless of Phase A repro outcome.

#### Defensive hardening from ooxml-swift v0.13.3

- `DocxReader.read` is now fully serial (libxml2 thread-safety + recovery determinism)
- `nextImageRelationshipId` delegates to allocator-based `nextRelationshipId` (fragile naïve counter eliminated)

### Tests

- 93 baseline + 7 new = **100/100 tests pass** (1 InsertCrashRegression skipped — fixture not present):
  - `StructuredLoggingTests` (2 scenarios): default-off, debug-on event capture
  - `InsertCrashRegressionTests` (1 scenario, XCTSkip fallback): 3-sequential-insert smoke
  - `AutosaveDesignBTests` (4 scenarios): mid-batch durability, Nth-mutation timing, N=0 disable, save cleanup + counter reset
- Pre-existing v3.6.0 `AutosaveCheckpointTests` updated to match Design B semantics (3 of 9 scenarios edited; 6 unchanged).

### Compatibility

- **MCP API surface** — no removed tools; `autosave_every` parameter now defaults to `1` (was `0`); `CHE_WORD_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` env var is optional.
- **No `ooxml-swift` API change** — bumped from `0.13.2` to `0.13.3` (PATCH, internal refactor).
- Universal binary (x86_64 + arm64) preserved.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added — Autosave + checkpoint + recover_from_autosave (closes [#37](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/37))

`save_document` is the only durability checkpoint pre-v3.6.0 — accumulated in-memory edits between explicit saves are lost on MCP crash. v3.0.0's `autosave: true` flag wrote to the source path on every mutation (eager-save), which defeats post-crash recovery against externally-edited targets (e.g., Word.app saved newer content between sessions).

v3.6.0 introduces a per-mutation throttled checkpoint to a **separate file** (`<source>.autosave.docx`) plus an explicit `recover_from_autosave` tool. Caller sees the autosave file via `get_session_state.autosave_detected: true` and decides whether to recover; the server never auto-recovers on `open_document`.

### New MCP tools

```
checkpoint(doc_id, path?)
  → Manual snapshot. Writes current in-memory bytes to `path` (or
    `<source>.autosave.docx` by default). Does NOT clear is_dirty.

recover_from_autosave(doc_id, discard_changes?)
  → Replace in-memory state with bytes from `<source>.autosave.docx`.
    Refuses with E_DIRTY_DOC if session has uncommitted mutations
    unless discard_changes: true (mirrors close_document dirty-check).
    Sets is_dirty: true after recovery; autosave file persists until
    next successful save_document cleans it up.
```

### New `open_document` argument

```
autosave_every: Int = 0
  → 0 disables autosave (default, preserves pre-v3.6.0 behavior).
  → N > 0 → every Nth successful mutation triggers a checkpoint write
    to `<source>.autosave.docx`. Counter is per-session (resets on close).
```

### `get_session_state` response additions

```
autosave_detected: Bool      // true when <source>.autosave.docx exists
autosave_path: String?       // file path or "(none)"
```

### Cleanup semantics

- Successful `save_document` deletes `<source>.autosave.docx` if it exists
- Successful `finalize_document` does the same
- `checkpoint` and `recover_from_autosave` do NOT touch the cleanup logic

### Architecture

Per the SDD Decision (Phase 4): per-N-mutations is the simplest throttle that captures the stated incident pattern (12 mutations → 1 save). Time-based throttle (autosave every 30s) and WAL journal-based recovery were rejected as over-engineering for v1. Single overwriteable autosave file (no `<source>.autosave-<ts>.docx` rotation) keeps retention policy out of scope.

```swift
// Server.swift
private var autosaveEvery: [String: Int] = [:]      // 0 = disabled
private var autosaveCounter: [String: Int] = [:]    // increments per mutation

// In storeDocument(markDirty: true) — after the dictionary writes:
if let n = autosaveEvery[docId], n > 0,
   let sourcePath = documentOriginalPaths[docId] {
    let next = (autosaveCounter[docId] ?? 0) + 1
    autosaveCounter[docId] = next
    if next % n == 0 {
        try DocxWriter.write(doc, to: URL(fileURLWithPath: sourcePath + ".autosave.docx"))
    }
}
```

Both new dicts are actor-isolated stored properties — same concurrency safety as v3.5.4's actor refactor.

### Tests

- `AutosaveCheckpointTests.swift` (NEW) — 9 tests covering all 5 new spec requirements:
  - `testAutosaveEveryNthMutation` — N=3, 7 mutations, checkpoints at #3 and #6
  - `testAutosaveEveryZeroDisables` — 100 mutations, no autosave
  - `testSaveDocumentCleansUpAutosave` — autosave deleted on save success
  - `testCheckpointDefaultPath` — manual checkpoint to autosave path; is_dirty preserved
  - `testCheckpointExplicitPath` — manual checkpoint to arbitrary path; autosave path untouched
  - `testOpenDocumentDetectsExistingAutosave` — stale autosave file flagged
  - `testOpenDocumentReportsFalseAutosave` — false when no autosave
  - `testRecoverFromAutosaveReplacesSession` — 12-paragraph autosave replaces 1-paragraph session, is_dirty: true
  - `testRecoverFromAutosaveRefusedOnDirty` — E_DIRTY_DOC without discard_changes
- **93/93 che-word-mcp tests pass** (was 84 → +9).

### Compatibility

- **Additive API** — `autosave_every` defaults to 0 (disabled) so existing callers see no behavior change. `checkpoint` + `recover_from_autosave` are net-new tools (no existing call site to break).
- **Tool count** bumped from 171+ to **173+** (added `checkpoint` + `recover_from_autosave`).
- **No `ooxml-swift` change** — implemented entirely in che-word-mcp server layer.
- Universal binary (`x86_64 + arm64`) preserved.

### Refs

- This is **Phase 4 (final)** of the [`che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack) Spectra change. Phases 1-3 closed in v3.5.3 / v3.5.4 / v3.5.5. SDD will be archived after this release.

## [3.5.5] - 2026-04-23

### Added — `keep_bak` opt-in for rollback escape hatch (closes [#38](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/38))

Pre-v3.5.5 `save_document` overwrote the target unconditionally. If a future save shipped silent OOXML damage (think v3.4.0 header strip, v3.5.0 rels regen), the original was permanently destroyed — no rollback path.

v3.5.3's atomic-rename save guarantees the target is never partial / zero-byte / absent, but it does NOT preserve the *previous-save* contents. `keep_bak` adds an opt-in escape hatch.

### Architecture

```swift
// che-word-mcp/Sources/CheWordMCP/Server.swift
private func persistDocumentToDisk(
    _ document: WordDocument, docId: String, path: String,
    keepBak: Bool = false   // NEW
) throws {
    let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
    if keepBak, FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {
        let bakURL = url.appendingPathExtension("bak")
        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: bakURL.path) {
            try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: bakURL)   // single-slot, no rotation
        }
        try FileManager.default.moveItem(at: url, to: bakURL)
    }
    try DocxWriter.write(document, to: url)   // atomic-rename (v3.5.3)
    // ... session state refresh (unchanged) ...
}
```

`save_document` MCP tool gains `keep_bak: bool` argument (default `false`):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "save_document",
  "arguments": {
    "doc_id": "thesis",
    "keep_bak": true     // optional, default false
  }
}
```

Per the SDD Decision (Phase 3): `.bak` lives at the **server layer**, NOT `ooxml-swift` — keeps `DocxWriter` unopinionated about file-system side effects so other consumers (e.g., `macdoc` CLI) don't get surprise `.bak` files.

### Behavior

- `keep_bak: true` + target exists → target moved to `<path>.bak` BEFORE atomic-rename save. Single-slot: any prior `.bak` is overwritten. User can `mv <path>.bak <path>` to roll back.
- `keep_bak: true` + target does not exist (first save) → no-op (nothing to back up).
- `keep_bak: false` (default) → no `.bak` side-effect (preserves pre-v3.5.5 behavior).
- `.bak` cleanup is the caller's responsibility — server never auto-deletes.

### Tests

- 80 baseline tests pass unchanged + 4 new `BakPreservationTests`:
  - `testKeepBakTruePreservesPreSaveBytes` — SHA256 of `.bak` matches original.
  - `testKeepBakDefaultOptOut` — no `.bak` when arg omitted.
  - `testConsecutiveSavesOverwriteBak` — second save's `.bak` matches first save's output, not original-original.
  - `testFirstTimeSaveNoBak` — fresh save with non-existent target produces no `.bak`.
- **84/84 che-word-mcp tests pass**.

### Compatibility

- **No API breaking change** — `keep_bak` is additive; default `false` matches pre-v3.5.5 behavior.
- **No `ooxml-swift` change** — fix is entirely in `che-word-mcp` server layer.
- Universal binary (`x86_64 + arm64`) preserved.

### Refs

- This is **Phase 3** of the [`che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack) Spectra change. Phase 1 (#36) shipped in v3.5.3, Phase 2 (#39) in v3.5.4, Phase 4 (#37) follows.

## [3.5.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed — class → actor refactor for concurrency safety (closes [#39](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/39))

Pre-v3.5.4 `WordMCPServer` was declared as `class` with 8 unsynchronized `var` dictionary properties:

```swift
class WordMCPServer {
    internal var openDocuments: [String: WordDocument] = [:]
    private var documentOriginalPaths: [String: String] = [:]
    private var documentDirtyState: [String: Bool] = [:]
    private var documentAutosave: [String: Bool] = [:]
    private var documentTrackChangesEnforced: [String: Bool] = [:]
    private var documentDiskHash: [String: Data] = [:]
    private var documentDiskMtime: [String: Date] = [:]
    // ...
}
```

When parallel async tasks (e.g., 12 concurrent `insert_image_from_path` calls in the 2026-04-23 incident) all called `try await storeDocument(doc, for: docId)`, those tasks landed on different threads and mutated the same `Dictionary` hash table without synchronization → hash table corruption → MCP process crash during subsequent `save_document` (which tried to read the corrupted state).

v3.5.3's atomic-rename save prevented data loss when the crash hit, but the underlying race remained — closed by this actor refactor.

### Architecture

```swift
// v3.5.4+:
actor WordMCPServer { ... }   // compiler-enforced isolation
```

Properties:
- All 8 mutable dictionaries become **actor-isolated stored properties** — every cross-actor access requires `await` (compiler-checked at every call site).
- Same-actor calls (e.g., `await self.storeDocument(...)` from `insertImageFromPath`) do NOT introduce a suspension point — Swift's actor model optimizes them to synchronous calls. Read-mutate-write cycles within mutating handlers run atomically.
- MCP swift-sdk handlers are already `async throws`, so the signature change surface is small. Test helpers gain `await` at call sites.

### Reentrancy audit

Every `await self.<method>()` path in mutating handlers (`insertImageFromPath` → `storeDocument`, `saveDocument` → `persistDocumentToDisk`, `closeDocument` → `removeSession`, `openDocument` → `initializeSession`, `flushDirtyDocumentsOnShutdown` loop) was audited:

- All mutating handlers perform state mutations in a single synchronous block (no `await` between dictionary writes).
- `storeDocument` / `persistDocumentToDisk` are sync internally; `async throws` exists only for caller-side compatibility.
- No reordering needed — invariants trivially preserved.

### Tests

- 79 baseline tests pass unchanged + 1 new `ActorIsolationStressTests.testParallelInsertImageDoesNotCrash` (50 concurrent inserts × 5 iterations = 250 mutations against the same `doc_id`; asserts no crash + final image count == 50).
- ThreadSanitizer note: macOS Xcode/SwiftPM has a known bug loading TSan too late for `swift test -Xswiftc -sanitize=thread`. The actor model itself provides compile-time race-freedom; the stress test verifies behavior + state integrity. Pre-v3.5.4 reproduces the crash at as few as 12 concurrent inserts without any sanitizer.
- **80/80 che-word-mcp tests pass**.

### Compatibility

- **Public API** — all 146 MCP tools work identically; calls were already `async`.
- **Test helpers** — `isDocumentDirtyForTesting`, `isTrackChangesEnabledForTesting`, `imageCountForTesting` (NEW) require `await` from outside the actor. Updated `WordMCPServerTests.swift` + `SessionStateTests.swift` accordingly.
- Universal binary (`x86_64 + arm64`) preserved.

### Refs

- This is **Phase 2** of the [`che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack) Spectra change. Phase 1 (#36 atomic save) shipped in v3.5.3. Phase 3 (#38 .bak) and Phase 4 (#37 autosave/checkpoint/recover) follow.

## [3.5.3] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed — Atomic-rename save in DocxWriter (closes [#36](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/36))

The 2026-04-23 incident (12 parallel `insert_image_from_path` + `save_document` → MCP crash → original 169KB docx replaced with 0-byte file) had the same root cause as a class of historical "save crash = data loss" reports: pre-v0.13.2 `DocxWriter.write` deleted the target file BEFORE computing the new bytes. Any throw or process kill between delete and write left the user with no recovery path.

### Resolution

v3.5.3 consumes [`ooxml-swift v0.13.2`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.2) which refactors `DocxWriter.write(_:to:)` to the atomic-rename pattern:

1. Compute new bytes (overlay or scratch serialization).
2. Write bytes to `<url>.tmp.<UUID>` temp file.
3. `FileHandle.synchronize()` (fsync) to flush kernel buffers to disk.
4. `FileManager.replaceItemAt(url, withItemAt: tempURL, ...)` — POSIX `rename(2)` on same volume (kernel-atomic), copy+delete on cross-volume.
5. `defer { try? FileManager.removeItem(at: tempURL) }` cleans up on every exit path.

Properties:
- **Atomicity** — external observers see either full original or full new bytes at `url`, never partial / zero-byte / absent.
- **Throw-safe** — failure at any step (serialization, temp write, rename) leaves `url` byte-preserved.
- **fsync'd** — power loss after rename guarantees the new bytes are durable.

### Tests

- 79/79 che-word-mcp tests pass (no consumer-side regression).
- Underlying ooxml-swift v0.13.2 ships 397/397 tests including new `AtomicSaveTests` (6 tests) — headline test spins a concurrent observer thread polling `fileExists(atPath:)` during write; pre-v0.13.2 caught a window where the file was absent, v0.13.2 the observer never sees the gap.

### Compatibility

- **No source code changes** to che-word-mcp itself — fix is entirely in ooxml-swift dep.
- **No API change**: `DocxWriter.write` signature unchanged; semantic guarantee strictly stronger.
- Universal binary (`x86_64 + arm64`) preserved from v3.5.1.

### Refs

- This is Phase 1 of the [`che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-save-durability-stack) Spectra change. Phase 2 (#39 actor refactor), Phase 3 (#38 .bak preservation), Phase 4 (#37 autosave/checkpoint/recover) ship as subsequent releases.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed — rels overlay merge preserves unknown rels types (closes [#35](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/35))

v3.5.0 + v3.5.1 closed [#23 round-2](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/23) at the **parts layer** (41/42 parts byte-equal on no-op round-trip) — but the **rels layer** still had two regressions:

**Root cause A** — `DocxReader.extractImages` was directory-driven: walked `word/media/` and used `targetToId[targetPath] ?? "rId_\(fileName)"` as fallback. The fallback produced ids like `rId_image1.png` violating the OOXML `rId[0-9]+` convention AND made `hasNewTypedRelationships` return true on no-op load → forced rels regeneration.

**Root cause B** — `writeDocumentRelationships` built rels **from the typed-model parts list only**. Original rels for **unknown types** (theme / webSettings / customXml / commentsExtensible / commentsIds / people) were silently dropped. After any legitimate edit (e.g., `addHeader`), NTPU theses lost theme inheritance + comment author identity even though parts were byte-preserved.

### Resolution

v3.5.2 consumes [`ooxml-swift v0.13.1`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.1) which introduces:

1. **`RelationshipsOverlay`** — parallel to `ContentTypesOverlay` from v0.12.0. Parses original `word/_rels/document.xml.rels`; merges typed-model rels with preservation of unknown rel types.
2. **`writeDocumentRelationships` overlay-mode dispatch** — calls `RelationshipsOverlay.merge` in overlay mode; scratch mode preserves pre-v0.13.1 output.
3. **`extractImages` rewritten relationship-driven** — iterates `relationships.imageRelationships` (source of truth); tries multiple path normalizations; skips orphan rels rather than forge ids.

### Tests

- 79/79 che-word-mcp tests pass (no consumer-side regression).
- Underlying ooxml-swift v0.13.1 ships 391/391 tests including 3 new `RelationshipsOverlayTests` cases.

### Compatibility

- **No source code changes** to che-word-mcp itself — fix is entirely in ooxml-swift dep.
- **No API change**: `RelationshipsOverlay` is internal to ooxml-swift.
- **Behaviour change** (intended): no-op round-trip + edit round-trip both preserve unknown rels types. Callers who expected the lossy regenerate behavior — there are no known such callers.
- Universal binary (`x86_64 + arm64`) preserved from v3.5.1.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed — universal binary (x86_64 + arm64)

v3.5.0 was shipped as **arm64-only** because the release-build step ran a single-arch `swift build -c release`. Intel Mac users (Mac Pro 2019, MacBook Pro 16" Intel, etc.) couldn't run the binary at all (`Bad CPU type in executable` from `exec`).

v3.5.1 follows the documented `mcp-deploy` Phase 1 workflow:

```bash
swift build -c release --arch arm64
swift build -c release --arch x86_64
lipo -create .build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/CheWordMCP \
              .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/release/CheWordMCP \
              -output mcpb/server/CheWordMCP
xattr -cr mcpb/server/CheWordMCP

mcpb/server/CheWordMCP: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64]
```

### Compatibility

- **No source code changes** — same Server.swift / ooxml-swift v0.13.0 contract as v3.5.0.
- **Drop-in replacement**: existing `~/bin/CheWordMCP` (arm64) can be replaced via wrapper auto-download or manual `cp`. No config / API changes.
- All 79/79 tests still pass (no semantic change since v3.5.0).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed — true byte-preservation via dirty tracking (closes [#23 round-2](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/23), [#32](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/32), [#33](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/33), [#34](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/34))

v3.3.0 + v3.4.0 closed [#23](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/23) at the **part-existence** level (preserve unknown parts byte-for-byte through `archiveTempDir` + `ContentTypesOverlay`), but the round-2 incident report showed the writer **still unconditionally re-emitted** every typed-managed part on every save. So a Reader-loaded NTPU thesis lost:

- 13 custom font declarations (`fontTable.xml` collapsed to a hardcoded 3-entry default)
- 6 distinct headers (all `.default` headers collapsed to `header1.xml` lookup)
- 4 distinct footers (same `.default` collapse)
- The verbose three-segment `<w:fldChar>` + `<w:instrText>PAGE</w:instrText>` PAGE field detection (only `<w:fldSimple>` matched)
- The full `<w15:presenceInfo>` person identity (only the `author` attribute survived; the GUID inside `userId="S::EMAIL::GUID"` was dropped)

after a single no-op `save_document` round-trip even though no typed mutation had occurred.

v3.5.0 fixes the architectural gap by consuming [`ooxml-swift v0.13.0`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.0) which introduces:

1. `WordDocument.modifiedParts: Set<String>` — every mutating method instruments the corresponding part path; reader clears it as the final step
2. `Header.originalFileName` / `Footer.originalFileName` — preserves source archive paths so multi-instance same-type files don't collapse
3. `DocxWriter` overlay-mode skip-when-not-dirty — typed-part writers gated by `modifiedParts.contains(<part path>)`

### Server-side wiring (Task 2.2)

Every Server.swift archive-write helper now joins the dirty-tracking contract:

| Helper | New behavior |
|---|---|
| `writeThemeXML` | calls `doc.markPartDirty("word/theme/theme1.xml")` |
| `writeArchivePart` | calls `doc.markPartDirty(partPath)` |
| `deleteHeader` / `deleteFooter` | calls `doc.markPartDirty("[Content_Types].xml")` + `"word/_rels/document.xml.rels"` |
| `setDocumentProperties` | calls `doc.markPartDirty("docProps/core.xml")` (since `properties` is direct field assignment) |
| `updateNoteImpl` | calls `doc.markPartDirty("word/footnotes.xml" or "word/endnotes.xml")` (typed in-place mutation bypasses public methods) |

Without these, `save_document` overlay mode would skip re-emitting the touched parts.

### `<w15:presenceInfo>` parsing rewrite (closes [#34](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/34))

`extractPeople` was rewritten from single-attribute regex to a multi-line parser that captures the full `<w15:person>...</w15:person>` block including the nested `<w15:presenceInfo>` child. Extracted fields:

- `userId` triple-segment `S::EMAIL::GUID` decomposition (split on `::` with maxSplits=2)
- `providerId` (e.g., `AD`, `None`)
- optional `color`

`list_people` now returns dual-identity JSON entries:

```json
{
  "person_id": "<GUID, fallback to author>",
  "display_name_id": "<author, v3.4.0 legacy id>",
  "display_name": "<author>",
  "email": "<from userId middle>",
  "color": "...",
  "provider_id": "..."
}
```

`update_person` and `delete_person` accept **either** form — try GUID match first, fall back to author. Existing v3.4.0 callers continue to work unchanged.

### Detection helper strengthening (closes [#32](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/32) + [#33](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/33))

- `headerHasWatermark` adds `<v:shape ... o:spt="136">` regex co-detection alongside the existing `PowerPlusWaterMarkObject` substring match. Combined with the v0.13.0 `originalFileName` fix this means `list_watermarks` actually reads each header's distinct fileName instead of all looking up `header1.xml`.
- `footerHasPageNumber` now detects the verbose three-segment `<w:fldChar w:fldCharType="begin"/>` + `<w:instrText>PAGE</w:instrText>` + `<w:fldChar w:fldCharType="end"/>` pattern. Word emits this verbose form when the field caches results, so real-world footers were missed by the pre-v3.5.0 `<w:fldSimple>`-only regex.

### Tests

- 5 `PeoplePresenceInfoTests` — full presenceInfo + GUID/author dual-id update + delete via either identifier
- +4 multi-instance cases in `HeadersFootersToolsTests` — 3-header fixture proves `list_headers` returns 3 distinct entries, `list_watermarks` correctly identifies only header2, three-segment PAGE field detection works, editing header2 leaves headers 1+3 byte-equal
- +2 dirty-tracking proofs in `Phase2BCSmokeTests` — `update_web_settings` preserves fontTable byte-equal; `add_person` preserves all other typed parts byte-equal

**Total: 79 tests pass** (was 68; +11 v3.5.0 contract coverage).

### Migration: person_id semantic change

In v3.4.0 `list_people` returned `{"person_id": "<author>"}`. In v3.5.0 `person_id` is the GUID extracted from `<w15:presenceInfo w15:userId="S::email::GUID"/>`, **falling back to author** when the presenceInfo lacks the GUID form.

| Caller intent | v3.4.0 | v3.5.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Identify person stably across rename | use `person_id` (= author, broke on rename) | use `person_id` (= GUID, stable) |
| Identify person by display name | use `person_id` (= author) | use `display_name_id` (= author) — new field |
| Address person in update/delete | pass `person_id` (= author) | pass either `person_id` (GUID) or `display_name_id` (author) |

`update_person` / `delete_person` accept either form, so existing v3.4.0 callers passing the author string continue to work unchanged. Callers that want GUID-stable addressing should migrate to the new `person_id` field.

The v3.4.0 `person_id` semantic (= author) will be **removed in v4.0.0**. Until then, v3.5.0+ callers should prefer `display_name_id` for the legacy author identifier.

### Underlying architecture

[`ooxml-swift v0.13.0`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/ooxml-swift/releases/tag/v0.13.0) — full architectural details. 388/388 ooxml-swift tests pass.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added — Phase 2B + 2C combined: comment threads + people + notes update + web settings (13 new MCP tools)

Combined release of Phase 2B + Phase 2C of [`che-word-mcp-ooxml-roundtrip-fidelity`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-ooxml-roundtrip-fidelity). Closes [#24](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/24), [#25](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/25), [#29](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/29), [#30](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/30), [#31](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/31).

**Scope adjustment from spec**: Phase 2B and Phase 2C were originally scheduled as separate v3.4.0 + v3.5.0 releases for incremental user value. Implementations landed in one continuous SDD-apply session, so combining into a single v3.4.0 release saves users one upgrade cycle without losing functionality.

### Comment thread tools (closes #29)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_comment_threads` | Enumerate threads using typed `Comment.parentId` (populated from `commentsExtended.xml` at parse time); each entry has root_comment_id + replies[] + resolved + durable_id |
| `get_comment_thread` | Read root + walk children to build reply tree |
| `sync_extended_comments` | Report typed comment count for triplet sync planning (full triplet writeback is a Phase 2B+ refinement) |

### People tools (closes #30)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_people` | Parse `<w15:person>` entries from `word/people.xml` |
| `add_person` | Add new entry; auto-create `people.xml` part when absent; duplicate-name handling with `_2` suffix |
| `update_person` | Update display_name (author attribute swap) |
| `delete_person` | Remove entry; report `comments_orphaned` count |

### Notes update tools (closes #24 #25)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_endnote` / `get_footnote` | Read text + runs by integer ID |
| `update_endnote` / `update_footnote` | In-place replace, preserves note ID so `<w:endnoteReference>`/`<w:footnoteReference>` cross-references in `document.xml` stay valid |

### Web settings tools (closes #31)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_web_settings` | Parse `word/webSettings.xml` flag elements (`relyOnVML`, `optimizeForBrowser`, `allowPNG`, `doNotSaveAsSingleFile`); return `{ error: "no webSettings part" }` when absent |
| `update_web_settings` | Partial update by key; auto-create part if absent |

### Behavior notes

- **Comment thread metadata triplet sync** (`commentsExtended.xml` + `commentsExtensible.xml` + `commentsIds.xml`) is **partial** in this release. Existing `insert_comment`/`reply_to_comment`/`resolve_comment`/`delete_comment` writers still update only `comments.xml` + (for some paths) `commentsExtended.xml`. Full four-part triplet auto-sync is documented as a Phase 2B+ enhancement; users who need consistent extended metadata can call `sync_extended_comments` to verify state.
- **Person record auto-creation on `insert_comment`** is also a future refinement; for now, callers explicitly add person records via `add_person`.

### Tests

61 → 68 (+7 in `Phase2BCSmokeTests`):
- `list_comment_threads` on empty doc
- `sync_extended_comments` returns counts
- Full add → list → delete person round-trip
- Duplicate person name handling with suffix
- Unknown endnote ID error
- `get_web_settings` no-part error
- `update_web_settings` creates the part

### Out of scope (for a future v3.5.x or v4.0)

- Full four-part comment metadata triplet auto-sync inside existing comment write tools
- People record auto-creation when `insert_comment(author:)` references unknown author
- `commentsExtended.xml` parent/child writer refinement
- `commentsIds.xml` UUID-based durable ID generation on each write

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added — Phase 2A: theme + headers/footers/watermarks tools (12 new MCP tools)

Phase 2A of the [`che-word-mcp-ooxml-roundtrip-fidelity`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/che-word-mcp-ooxml-roundtrip-fidelity) Spectra change. Closes [#26](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/26), [#27](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/27), [#28](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/28). Builds on v0.12.0 round-trip foundation.

**Theme tools** (`get_theme`, `update_theme_fonts`, `update_theme_color`, `set_theme`):
- Read/write `word/theme/theme1.xml` from preserved archive
- Partial-update major/minor font slots (latin/ea/cs)
- Slot-named color updates (accent1-6, hyperlink, followedHyperlink, dk1/lt1/dk2/lt2)
- Full-XML escape hatch for theme rewrites
- Solves NTPU thesis Chinese font fix: `update_theme_fonts(minor: { ea: "DFKai-SB" })` repairs the East-Asian font without touching other slots.

**Headers/Watermarks tools** (`list_headers`, `get_header`, `delete_header`, `list_watermarks`, `get_watermark`):
- Enumerate headers with type (default/first/even) + watermark detection
- Read header text + full XML + watermark structure
- Delete header part + tempDir file removal
- Watermark detection via `PowerPlusWaterMarkObject` shape ID + `o:spt="136"` sentinel
- Watermark text extraction via `<v:textpath string="...">` parsing

**Footers tools** (`list_footers`, `get_footer`, `delete_footer`):
- Enumerate footers with PAGE/NUMPAGES field detection
- Read footer text + full XML + parsed field structure (`<w:fldSimple>` + `<w:instrText>`)
- Delete footer part + tempDir file removal

### Changed — `add_header` / `update_header` / `add_footer` / `update_footer` use overlay-aware allocator

Via dependency bump to `ooxml-swift v0.12.2`, `WordDocument.nextRelationshipId` now reads `archiveTempDir`'s original `_rels/document.xml.rels` and uses `RelationshipIdAllocator` to compute collision-free `rId`s in overlay mode. Prior: naive `headers.count + footers.count` counter would collide with preserved unknown rels. Scratch mode behavior unchanged.

### Tests

49 → 61 tests (+12):
- `ThemeToolsTests` (6 tests): get_theme, partial font update, color slot update, invalid-slot rejection, set_theme malformed-XML rejection, no-theme-part error
- `HeadersFootersToolsTests` (6 tests): list_headers watermark detection, get_header XML+watermark, delete_header removal, list_watermarks text-watermark, list_footers page-number detection, get_footer PAGE field identification

### Dependencies

- `ooxml-swift` bumped from `^0.11.0` to `^0.12.0` (preserve-by-default round-trip), then patched via v0.12.1 (public archiveTempDir accessor) and v0.12.2 (overlay-aware nextRelationshipId)

### Out of scope (Phase 2B / 2C follow-up)

- Comment thread tools (`list_comment_threads`, `sync_extended_comments`, ...) — Phase 2B v3.4.0
- People tools (`list_people`, `add_person`, ...) — Phase 2B v3.4.0
- Notes update tools (`get_endnote`, `update_endnote`, `get_footnote`, `update_footnote`) — Phase 2C v3.5.0
- Web settings tools (`get_web_settings`, `update_web_settings`) — Phase 2C v3.5.0

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed — `insert_equation` LaTeX parser delegates to new `latex-math-swift` package

Closes [#22](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/22) via the `che-word-mcp-latex-parser-expansion` Spectra change in `PsychQuant/macdoc/openspec/changes/`.

The previous in-source `parseLatexSubset` parser (`Server.swift:7253-7371`, 30-entry whitelist of Greek + symbols + the macros `\frac` and `\sqrt`) is replaced by delegation to `LaTeXMathSwift.LaTeXMathParser.parse(_ latex: String) throws -> [MathComponent]`. This dramatically expands the macro coverage and resolves the long-standing schema-vs-implementation drift.

**New macro coverage** (full list in `latex-math-swift` README):

- `\frac{a}{b}`, `\sqrt{a}`, `\sqrt[n]{a}`
- Structural sub/superscript `a_{b}`, `a^{b}`, `a_{b}^{c}`, `a^{c}_{b}` — both orderings normalize to the same `<m:sSubSup>` element editable in MS Word
- Accents `\hat{x}`, `\bar{x}`, `\tilde{x}`, `\dot{x}`, `\overline{x}` → emit `<m:acc>` (depends on new ooxml-swift 0.11.0 `MathAccent` type)
- Delimiter pairs `\left(...\right)`, `\left[...\right]`, `\left\{...\right\}`, `\left|...\right|`, `\left\|...\right\|`
- N-ary operators with bounds `\sum_{a}^{b}`, `\int_{a}^{b}`, `\prod_{a}^{b}` (and bare versions without bounds)
- Function names `\ln`, `\sin`, `\cos`, `\tan`, `\log`, `\exp`, `\max`, `\min`, `\det` followed by `(...)` argument
- Limit forms `\sup_{x}`, `\inf_{x}`, `\lim_{x \to 0}`
- Plain-text-in-math via `\text{...}`
- All ECMA-376 §22.1.2.93 lowercase + uppercase Greek letters plus variants (`\varepsilon`, `\vartheta`, `\varphi`, `\varpi`, `\varrho`, `\varsigma`)
- Common operators `\cdot`, `\times`, `\pm`, `\mp`, `\sim`, `\approx`, `\neq`, `\le`, `\ge`, `\to`, `\infty`, `\partial`, `\nabla`, `\cdots`, `\ldots`, `\mid`, `\quad`, `\,`

### Behavior expansion (review before upgrading)

Equations that previously returned `unrecognized token` errors now succeed. This is the explicit purpose of the change, but callers SHOULD audit any test fixtures that asserted on the *failure* of specific tokens (e.g., `\Delta`, `\hat`, `\varepsilon`, `\sup`, `\left`, `\ln` as standalone token) and update them to expect the new successful path.

### Schema description rewrite

The MCP `tools/list` schema for `insert_equation`'s `latex` parameter is rewritten to enumerate the accurate supported macro families (see `Server.swift:2153`). The previous misleading "narrow subset" summary is removed. LLM tool-use prompts that cached the old description will see updated guidance on next `tools/list` call.

### Tests

49/49 XCTest cases pass (was 45). The 4 new tests in `Tests/CheWordMCPTests/InsertEquationGoldenTests.swift` cover all 18 thesis fixture equations from issue #22 with three layers of verification (parse, OMML element coverage, OMMLParser round-trip).

### Out of scope (Phase 2 / Phase 3 follow-up)

- Pandoc-equivalent token coverage (`\overset`, `\underset`, `\begin{matrix}`, `\stackrel`, `\xrightarrow`, etc.) — deferred to a follow-up issue.
- Per-token `components:` JSON snippet hint embedded in error messages (issue #22 Option C) — useful UX but orthogonal; deferred.
- `che-pptx-mcp` adoption of `latex-math-swift` — separate change opened when PPTX equation tooling is prioritized.

### Dependencies

- `ooxml-swift` bumped to `^0.11.0` (adds `MathAccent`)
- New: `latex-math-swift ^0.1.0` (https://github.com/PsychQuant/latex-math-swift)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added — 9 readback MCP tools (Caption CRUD + update_all_fields + Equation CRUD)

Closes [#17](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/17), [#19](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/19), [#21](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/21) via the `word-mcp-readback-primitives` Spectra change.

Built on new ooxml-swift 0.10.0 primitives (`FieldParser`, `OMMLParser`, `WordDocument.updateAllFields()`) that close the "write-side only" gap from v2.0.0. All 9 tools are thin MCP serialization layers over those parsers.

**Caption CRUD** (#17):
- `list_captions` — enumerate caption paragraphs with label / sequence_number / caption_text / paragraph_index.
- `get_caption` — detailed single caption info including optional `chapter_number` from STYLEREF.
- `update_caption` — modify caption text or label without breaking the SEQ field structure.
- `delete_caption` — remove caption paragraph (hint user to `update_all_fields` for renumbering).

**F9-equivalent** (#19):
- `update_all_fields` — recompute SEQ counters across body + headers + footers + footnotes + endnotes. Supports chapter-reset when `pStyle=="Heading N"` matches SEQ `resetLevel`. Non-SEQ fields (IF/DATE/PAGE/REF/etc.) preserved verbatim. Returns per-identifier final counts.

**Equation CRUD** (#21):
- `list_equations` — enumerate `<m:oMath>` runs with display_mode flag.
- `get_equation` — detailed single equation info with component summary.
- `update_equation` — replace target equation's components tree.
- `delete_equation` — remove equation run or empty paragraph.

### Internal changes

- `Server.swift`: changed `openDocuments` / `isDirty` / `storeDocument` from `private` to `internal` to allow the new `ReadbackTools.swift` extension to reach them. No external API impact.
- New file `ReadbackTools.swift` (~350 lines) houses the 9 handlers.

### Depends on

- ooxml-swift 0.10.0+

### Not in scope

- Full JSON→MathComponent parser for `update_equation` (minimal round-trip; equivalent to insert_equation's `components:` path). Advanced cases round-trip via `UnknownMath`.
- IF / DATE / PAGE field evaluation in `update_all_fields` — only SEQ counters recomputed.
- Integration tests for the 9 handlers — foundation tests (40 XCTest cases covering FieldParser/OMMLParser/updateAllFields) provide the guarantee. MCP-level integration tests deferred.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added — session state API

Closes [#12](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/12), [#13](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/13), [#15](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/15) via the `word-mcp-session-lifecycle` Spectra change.

Four new MCP tools + a new `SessionState` module give explicit visibility and control over the in-memory / disk state:

- **`get_session_state`** — snapshot of `{ source_path, disk_hash_hex, disk_mtime_iso8601, is_dirty, track_changes_enabled }`. Superset of `get_document_session_state` (which is preserved for backward compat).
- **`revert_to_disk`** — re-read source path, discard in-memory edits, reset dirty flag. Destructive-by-design, no force flag needed.
- **`reload_from_disk`** — cooperative reload that requires `force: true` on a dirty doc. Picks up external editor changes while protecting unsaved work.
- **`check_disk_drift`** — informational check returning `{ drifted, disk_mtime, stored_mtime, disk_hash_matches }`. Never errors unless `doc_id` missing.

Internals: 2 new parallel maps `documentDiskHash` / `documentDiskMtime` track SHA256 hash + mtime of source file; refreshed on `open_document` and `persistDocumentToDisk`. `SessionState` module (`Sources/CheWordMCP/SessionState.swift`) exposes `computeSHA256`, `readMtime`, `checkDriftStatus` helpers + `SessionStateView` struct. 15 new XCTest cases.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`open_document`**: `track_changes` default flipped from implicit-true to explicit-`false`. Callers who want tracked edits must now pass `track_changes: true`. Rationale: majority of scripted workflows (R→Word, batch replace, thesis caption renumber) want clean edits; track-changes-on-default was a review-workflow artifact. Closes [#13](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/13).
- **`close_document`**: new `discard_changes: Bool = false`. When the doc is dirty and `discard_changes` is false/absent, returns an error message containing `E_DIRTY_DOC` listing three recovery paths (`save_document` / `discard_changes: true` / `finalize_document`). Previously the dirty check raised a generic "unsaved changes" error; now the response is machine-parseable and action-oriented. Closes [#12](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/12).

### Migration

```
# 2.x — implicit track-changes-on
open_document(path, doc_id)

# 3.x — pass track_changes: true to preserve 2.x behavior
open_document(path, doc_id, track_changes: true)
```

```
# 2.x — dirty close raised invalidParameter error
close_document(doc_id)  # → error "unsaved changes"

# 3.x — dirty close returns text response with E_DIRTY_DOC
close_document(doc_id)  # → "Error: E_DIRTY_DOC ..."
close_document(doc_id, discard_changes: true)  # → closes without save
```

### Not in scope (follow-up candidates)

- Multi-session concurrent editing / locking
- Undo/redo beyond `revert_to_disk`
- FSEvents-based file watching (drift detection is lazy by design)
- Diff-display in `check_disk_drift` response (just reports booleans + timestamps)
- Partial reload (`reload_from_disk` is all-or-nothing)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added — text-anchor compound tool

Closes [#14](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/14). Eliminates the `search_text + insert_*` 2-call pattern by adding text-anchor parameters to insertion tools. A workflow that previously required 84 RPCs (Gao thesis: 12 images + 11 tables + 19 equations, each 2 calls for search + insert) can now be done in 42.

- **`insert_caption`** now accepts 5 anchor types (up from 3): `paragraph_index` | `after_image_id` | `after_table_index` | `after_text` | `before_text`. `text_instance: integer` (1-based, default 1) disambiguates when same phrase appears multiple times.

- **`insert_image_from_path`** now accepts `after_text` / `before_text` / `text_instance` in addition to `index` and `into_table_cell`.

- **Under the hood**: both handlers use new `InsertLocation.afterText(String, instance: Int)` and `.beforeText(...)` cases from ooxml-swift 0.9.0. Match is `substring contains` on flattened run text (cross-run safe, same algorithm as v2.0.0 `TextReplacementEngine`).

### Error handling

- **Text not found** → `Error: text 'X' not found (instance N)` with explicit search text + instance number. Fail fast, no fallback.
- **Multiple anchors provided** → `Error: exactly one of paragraph_index / after_image_id / after_table_index / after_text / before_text must be provided`.

### Depends on

- ooxml-swift 0.9.0+ (adds `.afterText` / `.beforeText` cases and `InsertLocationError.textNotFound`).

### Not in scope (follow-up)

- Regex / case-insensitive `after_text` matching (v1 is exact substring)
- Multi-paragraph-span matching
- `insert_paragraph` text-anchor support (schema exists but that tool isn't part of this bump)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added — batch API tools

Two new MCP tools to reduce per-call round-trip for bulk operations (e.g., thesis caption renumber, which previously required 26+ separate `replace_text` calls). Closes [#18](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/18).

- **`replace_text_batch`** — args `{ doc_id, replacements: [{find, replace, scope?, regex?, match_case?}], stop_on_first_failure?: bool, dry_run?: bool }`. Sequential application (each item sees previous items' results). Single `storeDocument` at end (vs N saves for N `replace_text` calls). `dry_run: true` skips disk write (in-memory doc still mutated; caveat in schema).
- **`search_text_batch`** — args `{ doc_id | source_path, queries: [string | { query, case_sensitive? }] }`. Loops existing `search_text` handler per query, aggregates results into single response. Works in both Direct Mode and Session Mode.

### Semantics notes

- **Sequential ordering**: documented in `replace_text_batch` schema. Batch `[A→B, B→C]` applied in order results in `C` (not `B`).
- **Non-atomic**: per-item failures (invalid regex) reported in aggregate response; already-applied items stay applied. Use `stop_on_first_failure: true` to halt.
- **Per-item options** override: each replacement entry can set its own `scope` / `regex` / `match_case`.

### Not in scope (follow-up issues may address)

- True single-pass `TextReplacementEngine` batch API (current implementation loops `Document.replaceText`, still O(N · docSize))
- `dry_run` undo of in-memory mutation (current: only skips disk write; caller must `open_document` again to reset)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed — MCP tool schemas expose v2.0.0 params

v2.0.0 rewrote the 4 tool handlers to accept new params (Chinese labels, `after_image_id`, `components`, `into_table_cell`, `scope`, `regex`, etc.) but **did not update the `inputSchema` JSON advertised via `tools/list`**. Result: Claude Code / Claude Desktop clients saw the OLD schema, never sent the new params, and the new handler branches never fired. This release corrects the schemas so v2.0.0 features are actually reachable.

Schema updates:

- **`insert_caption`**: `label` description lists all six valid values (`Figure` / `Table` / `Equation` / `圖` / `表` / `公式`). `paragraph_index` now optional; added `after_image_id: string` + `after_table_index: integer` (three-way anchor choice enforced in handler). Required reduced to `doc_id` + `label`.

- **`insert_equation`**: New `components: object` primary path (described with `type` discriminator + shape of `run` / `fraction` / `radical` / `subSuperScript` / `nary`). `latex` narrowed to subset-only fallback in description. Required reduced to `doc_id` only (must supply one of `components` / `latex`, enforced in handler).

- **`insert_image_from_path`**: `width` + `height` removed from `required` (auto-aspect supported). Added `into_table_cell: object` (shape `{ table_index, row, col }`). Required reduced to `doc_id` + `path`.

- **`replace_text`**: `all` removed from schema. Added `scope: string` (`body` | `all`), `regex: boolean`, `match_case: boolean`. Cross-run matching now described in the tool description.

### Infrastructure

No changes to internal engines — v2.0.0's `TextReplacementEngine`, `MathComponent` AST, `ImageDimensions`, `FieldCode` extensions, `InsertLocation` enum remain identical. This is strictly an MCP schema expose fix.

### Migration from 2.0.0

No code changes required. Clients that pulled v2.0.0 will start receiving the new `inputSchema` after the MCP server is restarted (or the plugin wrapper auto-downloads the v2.1.0 binary via version-aware check, shipped in plugin marketplace 2.0.1+).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Changed (BREAKING) — word-mcp-insertion-primitives Spectra change

Four MCP tools rewritten on new ooxml-swift 0.8.0 primitives. Closes [#6](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/6) (Phase 1-2), [#7](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/7) (fully), [#8](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/8) (Gaps A+D), [#9](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/9) (Phase 1-3).

- **`insert_caption` — now emits a real OOXML SEQ field**. The previous version wrote literal `{ SEQ Figure \* ARABIC }` characters into the docx; Word rendered those 23 characters verbatim. This release uses `SequenceField` (conforming to `FieldCode`) to emit proper `<w:fldChar>` begin/separate/end XML. Captions auto-number when Word opens the file and the user presses F9.
  - **New**: accepts Chinese labels `圖`, `表`, `公式` (plus English `Figure`, `Table`, `Equation`).
  - **New**: accepts exactly one of `paragraph_index` / `after_image_id` / `after_table_index` as the anchor (previously only `paragraph_index`).
  - **New**: `include_chapter_number: true` now emits a real `STYLEREF` field via `StyleRefField`, followed by `-`, then the `SEQ` field.

- **`insert_equation` — now emits structurally correct OMML**. The previous version passed LaTeX to `MathEquation` which did string substitution. This release introduces a `MathComponent` AST with nine types.
  - **New primary path**: `components:` argument — a JSON tree with `type` discriminators (`run`, `fraction`, `radical`, `subSuperScript`, `nary`).
  - **Narrowed `latex:` path**: limited to a documented subset (`\frac{a}{b}`, `\sqrt{a}`, `x^{y}`, `x_{y}`, Greek letters, ∑/∫/∏/·/×/±). Unrecognized tokens return an error naming the first bad token and referring callers to `components:`.

- **`insert_image_from_path` — width/height now optional, table-cell support added**.
  - **New**: one or both of `width` / `height` may be omitted; missing dimension auto-computed from the image's native pixel aspect ratio via `ImageDimensions.detect` (supports PNG, JPEG).
  - **New**: `into_table_cell: { table_index, row, col }` argument inserts the image as a paragraph inside the specified cell.

- **`replace_text` — now cross-run safe, with scope and regex options**. Previous per-run `contains(find)` matching failed silently across run boundaries (the thesis-workflow pain point in #7). New flatten-then-map algorithm.
  - **New**: cross-run matches succeed. Replacement text inherits the start run's formatting.
  - **New**: `scope: "body" | "all"` (default `"body"`). `"all"` scans headers, footers, footnotes, endnotes.
  - **New**: `regex: Bool` (default `false`) with `$1..$N` backreferences.
  - **Removed**: `all: Bool` argument. Behavior now always "replace all occurrences".

### Depends on

- ooxml-swift 0.8.0+ (was 0.5.6+).

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added (manuscript-review-markdown-export change in PsychQuant/macdoc)

- **New tools** — `export_revision_summary_markdown`, `compare_documents_markdown`, `export_comment_threads_markdown` (per-doc summary, multi-doc cumulative timeline, comment threading with author alias normalization). Closes [PsychQuant/che-word-mcp#2](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/2) [#3](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/3) [#4](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/4).
- **`AuthorAliasMap` helper** — shared canonicalization map used by the new comment-threading and timeline tools (e.g., `kllay's PC` → `Lay`).
- **ooxml-swift `WordDocument.getCommentsFull()`** — additive API returning the complete `Comment` struct including `parentId` for reply threading. Existing `getComments()` tuple API unchanged.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`get_revisions` and `compare_documents`** — `full_text: Bool = false` parameter REMOVED, replaced by `summarize: Bool = false` with INVERTED default. Default behavior now returns complete text with no upper bound. Pass `summarize: true` to elide individual entries longer than 5000 chars (head 30 + ` [...] ` + tail 30). Closes [PsychQuant/che-word-mcp#5](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/5).
  - **Migration**: callers passing `full_text: true` should remove the argument (default is now complete). Callers passing `full_text: false` should replace with `summarize: true`. The MCP server rejects `full_text` with an `invalidParameter` error pointing to the new parameter name.
  - **Rationale**: silent data loss via default truncation is harder to debug than context-window overflow. LLM callers can re-invoke with `summarize: true` if they hit context limits.
  - **Policy applies to**: all current and future che-word-mcp tools that return potentially long text. The `truncateText` internal helper now centrally enforces the 5000-char threshold.

### Notes

- This entry tracks Spectra change [`manuscript-review-markdown-export`](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/tree/main/openspec/changes/manuscript-review-markdown-export) in PsychQuant/macdoc, which advances umbrella tracking issue [PsychQuant/macdoc#75](https://github.com/PsychQuant/macdoc/issues/75).

## [1.18.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **`get_revisions` — hardcoded `prefix(30)` truncation** — Original and new revision text was truncated to the first 30 characters with `...` appended, regardless of actual length. Long insertions (e.g., entire rewritten paragraphs in Word track changes) were unreadable from the tool output; short revisions (e.g., adding an `s` suffix) had misleading `...` appended. The underlying OOXML parser always captured the full run text — the truncation was purely a display-layer bug present since v1.2.0. Fixed by routing through the existing `truncateText()` helper with a 500-character default. ([#1](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/1))

### Added
- **`get_revisions` — `full_text` parameter** — Opt-in flag to disable truncation entirely. When `full_text: true`, revision text is returned verbatim regardless of length. Default remains `false` (500-character head/tail summary) to protect LLM context from runaway insertions. ([#1](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-word-mcp/issues/1))

### Changed
- **`get_revisions` — output format** — Short revisions (≤ 500 chars) now return the full text with no `...` appended. Long revisions return `<first 30 chars> [...] <last 30 chars>` via `truncateText()`, matching the format used elsewhere in the codebase (heading/compare diff output). This is a breaking change for callers that depended on the literal `prefix(30)...` output.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Session State Management** — Track dirty state, autosave, and track changes enforcement per document (contributed by [@ildunari](https://github.com/ildunari))
- **`finalize_document`** — Save and close in one guarded step, reusing original path when available
- **`get_document_session_state`** — Inspect session state (dirty, autosave, track changes, save/close readiness)
- **`autosave` parameter** — `open_document` and `create_document` now accept `autosave: true` for auto-persist after each edit
- **Shutdown flush** — Server auto-saves dirty documents with known paths on shutdown
- **Duplicate docId guard** — `create_document` and `open_document` reject reusing an already-open docId
- **Track changes by default** — Documents opened/created automatically enable track changes
- **Unit tests** — 12 tests covering session state, dirty tracking, autosave, finalize, and shutdown flush

### Changed
- `save_document` — `path` is now optional; reuses original opened path when omitted
- `close_document` — Blocks closing documents with unsaved changes (use `save_document` first or `finalize_document`)
- Total tool count: 146 → 148

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Dual-Mode Access** — 15 read-only tools now support both `source_path` (Direct Mode) and `doc_id` (Session Mode): `get_document_info`, `get_paragraphs`, `list_images`, `list_styles`, `get_tables`, `list_comments`, `list_hyperlinks`, `list_bookmarks`, `list_footnotes`, `list_endnotes`, `get_revisions`, `get_document_properties`, `search_text`, `get_word_count_by_section`, `get_section_properties`
- **MCP Server Instructions** — Server now returns structured instructions during `initialize` handshake, helping AI agents understand Direct Mode vs Session Mode usage patterns
- **`resolveDocument` helper** — Internal helper for dual-mode document resolution with lock file detection
